CapstoneTwo_ DELI-cious
For this project, I made an application that functions as an online deli where users can place personalized orders for chips,drinks, and sandwiches.
There are price differences between the various sizes of drinks and sandwiches. Some sandwich toppings are also more expensive. Upon confirmation of an order, 
the application creates a receipt in the txt.file format. 

In creating the code, I got really confused and mixed up on how I wanted to separate the classes and add implement so that it aligns.
